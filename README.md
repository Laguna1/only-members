# README
In this project I`m working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.
* User can:
- create an account
- create post
* Only registered or logged in users can see the post`s author name.

![Non-authorized user](./1screen.png)
![Authorized](./2screen.png)

The project right now built without CSS styles.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
2.7.2

* Rails version
6.1.4.1
